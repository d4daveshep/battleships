# Game Rules

## Overview

The aim of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## Players

The game is played by two players. Either two humans using their own computer or by one human playing against a computer.

## Game board

The game board consists of two 10 by 10 grids representing a portion of ocean.
Each grid is labeled with ascending letters along the horizontal axis and with ascending numbers (starting from 1) along the vertical axis.
The two grids are arranged vertically.
The bottom board is called the "Player's Ships and Shots Received" grid is where the player places their 5 ships and records the shots received from their opponent.
The top board is called the "Shots Fired" grid and is where they fire their shots at their opponent's ships and mark the possible positions of the opponent's ships
Between the top and bottom grid is an area containing a line of squares broken up into the lengths of the ships with the ship name underneath. E.g. a line of 5 squares with the word Carrier underneath, a line of 4 squares with the word Battleship underneath. This area is called the Hits Made line.

## Ships

Each player starts the game with 5 ships, each ship has a length and a value of shots it can fire as shown below:

1. Carrier: length 5, 2 shots
2. Battleship: length 4, 1 shot
3. Cruiser: length 3, 1 shot
4. Submarine: length 3, 1 shot
5. Destroyer: length 2, 1 shot

## Ship placement

A player's ships can be placed anywhere on the bottom grid according to the following rules:

1. Ships can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal
2. Ships can be touching the edge of the board grid but can not go outside the grid or wrap around the grid
3. Ships cannot overlap or be touching another ship
4. There must be a empty space all around a ship (except where it touches the edge of the board)

When playing against a computer opponent, the computer will randomly place its ships on it's bottom board.

## Game play

Players place their 5 ships on their bottom grid, their top grid is empty.
The game consists of a number of rounds until a player wins or the game is drawn
Rounds are numbered in ascending order starting at round 1.

### Each round

1. Both players decide where to fire their available shots and enters them on their top grid with the round number (e.g. for round 1 they enter the number 1 in each grid square for each available shot)
2. Player1 tells Player2 where they have fired their shots using the alphanumeric grid reference for each shot (e.g. A-4, C-5, D-8, F-1 etc)
3. Player2 marks the shots on their bottom grid. If any of the shots coincide with a square that is part of a placed ship then this is considered a hit on that ship. E.g. if Player2 has their Battleship at D-3 to D-6 and Player1 fires a shot at D-4, this is considered a hit on the Battleship.
4. Player2 tells Player1 which, if any, ships they have hit with their shots (e.g. 1 hit on Carrier, 1 hit on Destroyer) and if any of their ships have been sunk
5. Player1 records these hits on the respective ship squares between the grids. E.g. If on round 3 Player2 tells Player1 that Player1's shots hit Player2's Battleship and Cruiser then Player1 records a 3 in their Battleship and a 3 in their Cruiser ships in the Hits Made area.

6. Player2 tells Player1 where they have fired their shots using the alphanumeric grid reference for each shot (e.g. A-4, C-5, D-8, F-1 etc)
7. Player1 marks the shots on their bottom grid. If any of the shots coincide with a square that is part of a placed ship then this is considered a hit on that ship. E.g. if Player1 has their Battleship at D-3 to D-6 and Player2 fires a shot at D-4, this is considered a hit on the Battleship.
8. Player1 tells Player2 which, if any, ships they have hit with their shots (e.g. 1 hit on Carrier, 1 hit on Destroyer) and if any of their ships have been sunk
9. Player2 records these hits on the respective ship squares between the grids. E.g. If on round 3 Player1 tells Player2 that Player2's shots hit Player1's Battleship and Cruiser then Player2 records a 3 in their Battleship and a 3 in their Cruiser ships in the Hits Made area.
10. That is the end of the round.

## Number of shot available

The number of shots available to a player in each round is the total number of shots for each unsunk ship.
E.g. at the start of the game no ships are sunk so each player has 5 shots available. If a player has it's Battleship and Submarine sunk then they only have 3 shots available.
When a player has had all their ships sunk they have no shots available so have lost the game.

## Firing shots

In each round, each player will fire the number of shots they have available to them.
All shots fired in a round by a player have the same number label.

## Recording hits on ships

Each player needs to keep track of the hits they have made on their opponents ships, these are made on the ships hit squares beneath the top grid.
This helps determine where to fire the player's next shots.
E.g. if they have hit their opponent's Battleship on round 1 and round 3, then they would be looking at their shots fired grid (top grid) to find where they fired shots on rounds 1 and 3 to see where the opponent's Battleship could be placed, knowing it is 4 squares long.

## Sinking ships

Each player needs to keep track of the hits they have made on their opponents ships.
This helps determine where to fire the player's next shots.

Players take turns at starting the game if multiple games are being played.

## Wining the game

The winner of the game is the player who sinks all their opponent's ships first.

## Drawing the game

If both players sink the last of their opponent's ships in the same round then the game is considered a draw.
