# Manual Testing Notes

After Implementation stage 2.5 was completed...

- [ ] Aimed shots board is not needed, I'd prefer to use the Shots Fired board aka "Opponent's Waters" board to place my shots.
- [ ] There is no way to actually record the shots. My preference is to click on the cells on Shots Fired board, have the aimed shots shown in an editable list with a Remove button by each aimed shot.
