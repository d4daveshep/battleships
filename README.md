# Battleships coding experiment using Claude Code (or alternative)

The point of this repo is to practice generating the code for a known game, in this case a version of Battleships, from a specification of the game rules, the interface, software architecture and deployment model

I'll generate the specification in a series of markdown files and then give these to the coding tool to generate code from

[Game Rules](Game_Rules.md)
[Code Architecture](Code_Architecture.md)
